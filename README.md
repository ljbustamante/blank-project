## Deployment ðŸš€

We use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/es/actions/quickstart) to deploy our new releases. To ensure that everything works well, follow the development workflow.

#### Release to Staging:

In order for you to release a Staging version, you send your commit into main branch. After that, the GithubAction should begin the deployment.

#### Release to Production:

If all your tests are approved and you are ready to take your change to production, you just need create a release from the last tag.
